##### PhoneBook is a project built in two different ways, with Flutter and with React Native.
#
#
#
#

## Features

- Add a new contact to you list.
- Remove a specific contact.
- Update/edit a contact.
- Search inside your phone book based on their name, last name, or their phone number.
#
- ALL FEATURES CAN BE USED BOTH WITH THE FLUTTER AND REACT NATIVE APP.



## Use

PhoneBook requires multiple packages and appications to run properly.

Once you have the git repository cloned in your machine, you can follow the next steps to run the project.
#
#
#

#### React Native
To run the React Native project, you need to have all the packages and requirments of a normal project, such as React, react-native, react-navigation, etc. 

You can install them using npm, but before that, you need to go to the specific folder:

```sh
cd react_native/PhoneBook
```
Once you are in the correct folder, you can install the dependencies and packages, for example:

```sh
npm install react-native
npm install react
```

#
#
#

#### Flutter

To run the flutter project, you need to have all the packages and requirments of a normal project, such as Dart and Flutter. 

Then, you need to change the directory to a specific folder:

```sh
cd flutter
```
Once you are in that directory, you can run it with your favorite code editor (Make sure it supports Dart).
